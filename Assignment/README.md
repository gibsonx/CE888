## About The Project
Just open it in the colab and click run all with GPU ！！

So far I haven't separated libs into independant .py files. I will abstract functions into classes as soon as possible. 

Warning: sometimes GPU on Colab is out of service, it is impossible to run it with CPU due to resource limitation of free edition.
