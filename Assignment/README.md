## CE888 Assignment 2 (Final project)
No additional step is needed for running Assignment 2! just open [Assignment_2.ipynb](https://github.com/gibsonx/CE888/blob/master/Assignment/Assignment_2.ipynb) in the colab and click "run all" with "GPU".

Installation Script Description:
1. The program will automatically download all datasets form https://github.com/cardiffnlp/tweeteval.git at the beginning.
2. To make the notebook tidy, I wrote two independent auxiliary lib files(CE888_Transformer.py and CustomizedPlots) for data normalization and building models. They will be downloaded and imported from https://github.com/gibsonx/grocery.git

Warning: sometimes GPU on Colab is out of service, it is impossible to run it with CPU due to RAM limitation of free edition.
