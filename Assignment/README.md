## About The Project
Just open [sentiment_analysis_twitter.ipynb](https://github.com/gibsonx/CE888/blob/master/Assignment/sentiment_analysis_twitter.ipynb) in the colab and click "run all" with "GPU" ！！

The program will download datasets form https://github.com/cardiffnlp/tweeteval.git at the beginning. So far I haven't separated libs into independant .py files and will do it ASAP. Warning: sometimes GPU on Colab is out of service, it is impossible to run it with CPU due to RAM limitation of free edition.
