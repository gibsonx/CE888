## About The Project
Just open it in the colab and click run all with GPU ！！The program will download datasets form https://github.com/cardiffnlp/tweeteval.git at the beginning.

So far I haven't separated libs into independant .py files. I will abstract functions into classes as soon as possible. 

Warning: sometimes GPU on Colab is out of service, it is impossible to run it with CPU due to RAM limitation of free edition.
