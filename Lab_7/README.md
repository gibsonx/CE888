Complete the following tasks: 

### Task 1

Go to [Exercise 1](https://github.com/sagihaider/CE888_2021/blob/main/Lab_7/Exercise_1_CNN.ipynb) and find task 1. Now, change the activation function and other parameters such as optimizer to see the effect on the network and it's performance. If possible create a grid search.

### Task 2

Go to [Exercise2_DogvsCat_CNN](https://github.com/sagihaider/CE888_2021/blob/main/Lab_7/Exercise2_DogvsCat_CNN.ipynb) and find task 2. We have used Dropout to enhance the performance of the CNN model. Can you please use whatever you like to further enhance the performance from `val_acc: 0.7506` to above? 

### Task 3

Please consider this Time Series Prediction with LSTM Recurrent Neural Networks. We can see that the LSTM model in the [Exercise 3](https://github.com/sagihaider/CE888_2021/blob/main/Lab_7/Exercise_3_RNN.ipynb) has an average error of about 23 passengers (in thousands) on the training dataset, and about 53 passengers (in thousands) on the test dataset. Not that bad. Can you please improve the performance?
